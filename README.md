# RiskyCommitMiner
This is a tool I am developing as part of my school project. It interfaces with Apache.org(or another website. Depends how you configure) JIRA repositories, git source code and finds a list of JAVA classes that have changed as part of a bug fix. Those classes can be used to prioritize test cases.
